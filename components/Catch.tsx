    question: "Do I have to pay?",
    answer:
      "Laera is free to start! Get going with 25 free interactions per month with any of our accomplished tutors. Artificial intelligence is expensive though ðŸ¥´, so we offer a paid plan to our extra motivated students with up to 500 interactions per month.",

    question: "How do I know the answers are correct?",
    answer:
      "Laera has been ingested nearly all of the information on the internet and has a strong foundation in the subjects we've specially prepared it for. That being said, we encourage you to fact check any answer a Laera tutor gives you, as this is meant to be a study guide and not a tool to replace your own work. Do not use Laera to do anything that violates your schools code of conduct.",

    question: "Do you have a mobile app?",
    answer:
      "Not yet! We're working on it, but for now you can use Laera on your phone's browser. To get the most out of Laera, we recommend using Chrome on your desktop or laptop.",
