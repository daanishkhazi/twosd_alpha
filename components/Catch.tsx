    answer:
      "Laera is free to start! Get going with 25 free interactions per month with any of our accomplished tutors. Artificial intelligence is expensive though ðŸ¥´, so we offer a paid plan to our extra motivated students with up to 500 interactions per month.",

    question: "How do I know the answers are correct?",
    answer:
      "Laera is built on the same technology that powers ChatGPT, which means that is has ingested nearly all of the internet's data. It is especially strong in the subjects we've prepared it for - History & Biology. That being said, we encourage you to fact check any answer a Laera tutor gives you, as this is meant to be a study guide and not a tool to replace your own work. Do not use Laera to do anything that violates your school's code of conduct.",
